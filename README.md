# Rev_n_Roll

Rev_n_Roll is a social website where users can find and organize car meets, races, and form crews.

## Features

### Find Car Meets
Finding car meets will be way easier. Whether you’re going abroad or to an unfamiliar city, you can meet the locals, see some cool cars, or just explore the car scene in the area. With this website, you can filter through car meets by city and put the address into Google Maps with a single click.

### Organize Your Meets
You can choose from public to private meets:
- **Public Meets**: Automatically show the address to other users.
- **Private Meets**: Add crews or people to your meet who’ll automatically get an invite to your meet in their email inbox with the address included. You can also choose an option where everyone can see the meet but they’ll have to ask for the address, except for the crew or people you added.

### Form Crews
Create a group you like to go cruising with or just meeting. With this website, they’ll get notified about future meets. In the crew, you have multiple ranks to give to people:
- **Leader**: The creator of the crew (only one per crew).
- **Co-Leader**: Has the same permissions as the leader but cannot promote someone to co-leader.
- **Recruiters**: Can invite people into the crew if it’s private but cannot do more than normal members. You can also set it up so everyone can invite people without recruiters.

### Find Races
Find races in your exact type and apply to join a race. Filtering through meets based on location and tags makes finding car meets easy.
